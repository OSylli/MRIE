Description: This package is used for Mendelian randomization analysis with a continuous exposure and a continuous outcome, where the exposure variable is potentially unmeasured or non-detectable. The estimations are carried out based on the maximum likelihood estimation method, and the EM algorithm is applied to cope with the incomplete measurements on the exposure.
